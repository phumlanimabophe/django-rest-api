# API Guidelines

In Django REST Framework, you can create APIs using either function-based views or class-based views. Here are the key differences:

## Function-Based Views

- These are simple and straightforward. They are written as Python functions.
- Each function handles a specific HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.).
- You need to use decorators like `@api_view` to specify which HTTP methods the function should respond to.
- They are suitable for simple use cases.

Example:

```python
from rest_framework.decorators import api_view
from rest_framework.response import Response

@api_view(['GET', 'POST'])
def customer_view(request):
    if request.method == 'GET':
        # handle GET request
        pass
    elif request.method == 'POST':
        # handle POST request
        pass
    return Response()

# Class-Based Views

Class-based views in Django REST Framework are more structured and reusable. They are written as Python classes. Each class can handle multiple HTTP methods. Each method is handled by a separate method of the class (e.g., `get()`, `post()`, etc.). They provide more flexibility and control, and are suitable for complex use cases. They support mixins and class inheritance, which can lead to more DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code.

Here is an example:

```python
from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework.response import Response

class CustomerView(APIView):
    def get(self, request):
        # handle GET request
        pass

    def post(self, request):
        # handle POST request
        pass

## Important Note for Maintainers

Please do not remove the `rest_framework` from the main project folder. It is a crucial part of our project infrastructure. Always ensure that it is up-to-date with the latest stable version. Regular updates are essential for the security and stability of our project. 

To update `rest_framework`, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install -U djangorestframework
